# CCL queries
The contents in this folder are the Cerner command language (CCL) based queries that should be run in Discern Visual Developer (DVD) to get the output that will be the inputs for this app

Note: The easiest way to run this is by saving the results directly from DVD into the data/ folder as CSVs. This is because DVD encodes a little bit differently versus pasting into Microsoft Excel and saving as a CSV
